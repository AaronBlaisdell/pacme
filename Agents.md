# PacMe (working agreements)

- Build a browser game like Pac-Man (PacMe) using HTML5 canvas + vanilla JS (no frameworks).
- Must include: upload photo -> crop to face -> generate circular avatar sprite (64x64 PNG).
- PacMe uses the uploaded player face sprite; 4 ghosts use uploaded face sprites.
- Everything runs locally in the browser: no server uploads, no external APIs.
- Provide a clean UI: upload buttons for PacMe and each ghost, crop modal (drag to pan, slider to zoom), Start/Pause/Reset.
- Persist avatars in localStorage.
- Include clear run instructions in README.
- Keep code readable and modular, with comments.
